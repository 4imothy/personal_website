                Iâ€™m a junior at Case Western Reserve University ('25) pursuing a double major in
                Computer Science and Mathematics. Throughout my journey in those fields, I have
                developed an interest in leveraging low-level languages with manual memory
                management, as well as exploring the realm of artificial intelligence. With these
                tools I have created extremely fast command line tools and games, as well as an
                efficient and high speed neural net framework. My other projects include a mobile
                phone game, chat app, sorting visualizer and more. All of these projects can be seen
                on my{' '}
